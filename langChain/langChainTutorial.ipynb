Candidate registration was from 5–14 October 2023 and the election was held in Egypt from 10 to 12 December; expatriates voted from 1–3 December.Incumbent President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who initially came to power in the aftermath of the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, was eligible for re-election since term limits were adjusted from four to six years by a constitutional amendment in 2019, and he technically will not have served as president for more than the maximum of 12 years at the time of the election. His rule has been described as authoritarian. On 18 December he was reported to have won with 89.6% of the vote. The voter turnout was stated to be 66.8% of registered voters.\n",
